Use Cases
=========

The BUDA framework is designed to enhance deception operations by integrating realistic, simulated user behaviors into cybersecurity defenses. This section describes the primary use cases that illustrate how BUDA can be applied in operational settings.

1. Attack Diversion and Early Detection
-----------------------------------------
BUDA generates realistic activity traces through simulated user profiles deployed on production workstations. This causes adversaries to interact with decoy systems instead of targeting critical assets. Key benefits include:

- **Early Detection:** As attackers engage with decoy environments, security systems can identify and alert on anomalous behaviors sooner.
- **Resource Diversion:** Adversaries are led away from genuine systems, reducing the likelihood of damage to vital infrastructure.

2. Monitoring System Calibration and Validation
-------------------------------------------------
By simulating human-like interactions, BUDA helps validate and calibrate monitoring solutions (e.g., SIEM and UEBA). This use case focuses on:

- **Parameter Tuning:** Automated simulation of user behavior allows for fine-tuning detection thresholds and reducing false positives.
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Continuous, realistic activity logs offer a basis for testing the sensitivity and accuracy of monitoring systems under varied scenarios.

3. Refinement of Cyber Deception Tactics
-----------------------------------------
BUDA serves as an experimental platform to refine and optimize deception strategies. Its dynamic generation of user profiles and activity patterns enables:

- **Tactical Experimentation:** Security teams can test different interaction patterns and timing variations to identify the most effective deception strategies.
- **Adaptability:** By adjusting the “personality” of fake profiles, the tool ensures that deceptive operations remain resilient against evolving attacker methodologies.

Additional Use Cases
--------------------
- **Scenario Testing:** BUDA can simulate complex, real-world attack scenarios in controlled environments, providing valuable insights for training and response planning.
- **Strategic Planning:** The framework supports the creation of coherent narratives that align with established frameworks (such as MITRE Engage), enhancing overall strategic planning for cyber defense.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Automation of profile generation and activity simulation reduces manual overhead, allowing security teams to focus on higher-level analysis and incident response.

Conclusion
----------
The use cases outlined above demonstrate BUDA’s potential to strengthen cyber deception operations. By introducing realistic user behavior into decoy environments, BUDA not only improves early detection and diversion of attacks but also enables continuous improvement of monitoring systems and tactical adjustments in response to emerging threats.
