User Profiles
=============

Overview
--------
User profiles in the BUDA framework represent the simulated identities that interact within the deception environment. These profiles are carefully designed to mimic real users by incorporating attributes such as name, role, behavior patterns, and routine activities. The goal is to create decoy identities that are realistic enough to engage attackers while reinforcing the overall deception strategy.

Key Components
--------------
User profiles in BUDA are managed through two primary components:

1. **Profile Creation Tool**
   - **Personalization:**  
     Define key attributes for each profile, such as the user's name, role (e.g., IT Analyst, Administrative Staff), and other identifying characteristics.
   - **Behavioral Patterns:**  
     Configure routines and activities typical for the role. This includes setting work hours, application usage, file accesses, and communication habits.
   - **Variability Settings:**  
     Introduce controlled randomness to the behaviors, ensuring that interactions remain organic and avoid predictable patterns.

2. **Profile Library**
   - **Management and Reuse:**  
     Maintain a repository of created profiles that can be edited, duplicated, or removed as needed. This library helps in reusing profiles across different narratives and operational scenarios.
   - **Version Control:**  
     Keep a history of changes, allowing security teams to audit modifications and fine-tune profiles based on simulation feedback.
   - **Export Capabilities:**  
     Profiles can be exported in standard formats (such as JSON) for integration with other security tools and external systems.

Configuring User Profiles in BUDA
----------------------------------
Setting up user profiles involves several steps:

- **Manual Creation:**  
  Security teams can create profiles by manually specifying attributes and behavior parameters tailored to specific operational needs.
- **Assisted Generation:**  
  The system supports assisted profile creation using built-in templates and, if desired, integration with language models (LLMs) to automatically generate realistic profiles.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:**  
  Profiles can be adjusted on the fly based on simulation results or updated threat intelligence, ensuring they remain effective over time.

Conclusion
----------
Effective user profiles are crucial for establishing a believable deception environment in BUDA. By simulating realistic human behaviors and interactions, these profiles enhance the credibility of decoy operations, divert attackers, and provide valuable insights into adversary tactics. With robust creation and management tools, BUDA empowers security teams to maintain an agile and adaptive deception strategy.
